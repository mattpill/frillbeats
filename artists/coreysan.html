				<h1>Bio</h1>
				<p>Coreysan is a mysterious, soulful, rootsy, bass driven musician who brings an entirely new flavour to the electronic scene. Steering clear of imposed genres, Coreysan describes his music as Electronic Caribbean World Fusion.
				<br><br>
				The powerfully spirited islands of Trinidad and Tobago that is his homeland brings a Caribbean sound that is combined exquisitely with driving electronic soundscapes, soulfully earthy bass work and the hauntingly ethereal Theremin.
				<br><br>
				Raspy, soothing vocals complement the music with a storyteller approach to his lyrical compositions, reminiscent of Calypso with a universe perspective. A deep love for eastern/old world music has further influenced Coreysan's style, giving the music a deeply spiritual sheen. 
				<br><br>
				<span>The Bristol scene…</span>
				<br><br>
				The Bristol music scene has long been a love for Coreysan, promoting his relocation to the city that put underground music on the map. Now that he has recently settled in Bristol, a place where musical contributions have greatly influenced his musical direction (Tricky, Massive Attack, Phaeleh, Portishead, Drum & Bass, Dubstep etc),
				<br><br>
				Coreysan has self released a 6 song EP called  “In Transit” in October 2014 and is currently working on his new EP "The Trance and The Dance" which wil be released by Frillbeats Ltd, an independent record label based in Bristol in June 2015. 
				<br><br>
				<span>Collaborating…</span>
				<br><br>
				His love for the Bristol sound has led Coreysan to collaborate with a variety of local musicians including:
				<br><br>
				: Winner of two Exposure Music 2010 Awards for Best Male Artist and Best Urban Song, Alonestar (Jethro Sheeran). Coreysan has appeared as a bassist and vocalist/lyricist on a number of his musical productions including Real Life featuring his cousin Ed Sheeran. 
				<br><br>
				: His second major Bristol/Trinidad collaboration was with Kristian Townsend who also manages Reel Me Records (Laid Blak, Alonestar, J Rokka, Seventhly etc) where they collaborated on 2 tracks featuring vocals and lyrics from Coreysan called “Slave of Time” and “Return to One”. The tracks were released in March 2013 and have been remixed by both Jon Kennedy and Dubspeeka. 
				<br><br>
				: Unreleased collaborative work with Bristol based “End of the Line” 
				<br><br>
				: Featured narration in the promo video for good friends and fellow musicians “Jus Now” (Sam Interface and LazaBeam) yet another Bristol based Trini/Bristol collaboration.
				<br><br>
				<span>In his homeland…</span>

				<br><br>
				Coreysan is also a pioneer of the live electronic music scene in his homeland being the first musician to bring a computer to the stage as an instrument with his band Atheleny (2001-2004) and then with his solo project Coreysan (2006 – present).
				<br><br>
				<span>Gigs around the world…</span>
